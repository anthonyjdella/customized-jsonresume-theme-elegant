# Customized JSON Resume Theme: Elegant

üñºÔ∏è This is a tweaked version of the [Elegant theme](https://github.com/mudassir0909/jsonresume-theme-elegant). Tweaked to fit my design preferences.

## Notable Changes

* 2 Page version in PDF/printable mode 
* Added sections for speaking and articles
* Style changes

## Prerequisites

To build and start the local server, it needs to use the cli command, which is custom cli I tweaked.

`npm i @anthonyjdella/customized-resume-cli`

## How to Start

To re-build HTML changes, execute: `grunt exec:compile_pug`

To re-build CSS changes, execute: `grunt less`

Then to start,

`npm run start` for localhost:4000 

or `grunt exec:run_server` for localhost:8080


## How to Change

* `index.js` is the order of the resume. Also make changes to `background-card.pug`
* `pug/` are the html files for each section. To re-build HTML changes, execute: `grunt exec:compile_pug`
* `assets/less` is the styling. To re-build CSS changes, execute: `grunt less`
* To make changes to the PDF/printable version, make changes in the `@print` section of `assets/less/print.less`
* Change version number in `package.json`
* Deploy the changes via `npm publish --access public`
* To see changes from `resume.anthonydellavecchia.com` you need to go to the [registry project](https://github.com/anthonyjdella/customized-registry-functions), then cd into `functions`, run `npm i` and `npm update`, then `firebase deploy`.

##### Testing JSON changes
You can test your changes by updating `resume.json` file inside `node_modules/resume-schema/` folder. You might want to rerun `grunt exec:run_server` whenever you make any changes to `resume.json`

##### Updating Styles
All the LESS files are organized under the folder `assets/less/`. Please go through the comments inside `theme.less` to find out which file to put your LESS changes. Grunt compiles `assets/less/theme.less` to `assets/css/theme.css` which is used eventually in the theme.

**_Please Do not make any changes inside `assets/css/theme.css`_**

##### Updating Javascript
All the javascript changes go into `index.js` which is responsible for rendering the theme.

##### Adding a new icon
